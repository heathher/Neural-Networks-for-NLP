The jokes are flat, and the action looks fake.
Summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this.
Malcolm McDowell is cool. Paul Bettany is cool. Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell? Cool.

A slight but sweet film.

...this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core.
Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead, but they bring a fresh, quirky charm to the formula.
Even though we know the outcome, the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller, while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy.
I'm guessing the director is a magician. After all, he took three minutes of dialogue, 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long.
An unholy mess, driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape, it must be labelled 'hip', 'innovative' and 'realistic'.

Seagal ran out of movies years ago, and this is just the proof.
This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head

The film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip.
A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood, this movie strives to be more, but doesn't quite get there. Good performances keep it from being a total rehash.
Has no reason to exist, other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents.
The off-center humor is a constant, and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery.
A romantic comedy, yes, but one with characters who think and talk about their goals, and are working on hard decisions.

Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations, the movie passes inspection.

A slick, skillful little horror film.
The movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design.
A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick, a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem.
Despite its dry wit and compassion, the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing.

An extremely funny, ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary China.
A no-holds-barred cinematic treat.
I don't mind having my heartstrings pulled, but don't treat me like a fool.

Coy but exhilarating, with really solid performances by Ving Rhames and Wesley Snipes.
A solid, psychological action film from Hong Kong.
Hard, endearing, caring, warm. Bring tissues.
Most haunting about ``Fence'' is its conclusion, when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize, much to our dismay, that this really did happen. Noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping, dramatic, Hollywood moments to keep us
An Inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love, communal discord, and justice unfolds.
I am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from TV shows, but Hey Arnold! The Movie is clever, offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance.
Provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' I need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor, amusing characters, and a happy ending. After seeing 'Analyze That,' I feel better already.
But the power of these (subjects) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration, rather than contributing to a film's narrative.
Morvern rocks.
There are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them.
The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations. Then lower them a bit more.

A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches.
While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film, it's far from being this generation's Animal House.
The comedy makes social commentary more palatable.
Worth catching for Griffiths' warm and winning central performance.
The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second.
Between them, De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season.

It delivers some chills and sustained unease, but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning.
Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists.

It's better than mid-range Steven Seagal, but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades.

As it turns out, you can go home again.
The whole talking-animal thing is grisly.
A funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage ``be careful what you wish for'' is given a full workout.
The film is powerful, accessible and funny. You won't miss its messages, but you'll be entertained as well.
A decidedly mixed bag.
I can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but I almost can; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it.

Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool.
As blunt as it is in depicting child abuse, El Bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance.
You needn't be steeped in '50s sociology, pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of Haynes' work. Though Haynes' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade.
It's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another.
It's a glorified sitcom, and a long, unfunny one at that.
The film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design.

The result is something quite fresh and delightful.
An energetic, violent movie with a momentum that never lets up.

I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat. I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes, but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes.

Extremely bad.

Affable if not timeless, Like Mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids.
The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star, Jean Reno, who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep.
You've already seen Heartbreak if you've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard. Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original.
While Glover, the irrepressible eccentric of River's Edge, Dead Man and Back to the Future, is perfect casting for the role, he represents Bartleby's main overall flaw.
A mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
As violent, profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen.
This riveting World War II moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of American culture: racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms.
Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy, but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters, why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead?
Frenetic but not really funny.
Trapped won't score points for political correctness, but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness.
I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD. For free. I still want my money back.
The fourth in a series that I'll bet most parents had thought --hoped! -- was a fad that had long since vanished.
Huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it, channeling Kathy Baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women's Augustine.

Comes across as a fairly weak retooling.
Several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare.
Every note rings false.
Engrossing and affecting, if ultimately not quite satisfying.

Sound the trumpets: For the first time since Desperately Seeking Susan, Madonna doesn't suck as an actress.
A so-so, made-for-TV something posing as a real movie.

What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate.
Not a film to rival To Live, but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted.
High on melodrama. But it's emotionally engrossing, too, thanks to strong, credible performances from the whole cast.
I haven't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered.
What lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts, as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map.

Highly watchable stuff.

Alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise.
Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances, but the movie doesn't quite fly. For starters, the story is just too slim.
Audacious-impossible yet compelling...

Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear. But one thing's for sure: It never comes close to being either funny or scary.

under-rehearsed and lifeless
This is a very fine movie -- go see it.
A negligible British comedy.

There's lots of cool stuff packed into ESPN's Ultimate X.
Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year, which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while.
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once.
An overemphatic, would-be wacky, ultimately tedious sex farce.

The smartest bonehead comedy of the summer.
Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste.
Greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force, and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
Gaghan captures the half-lit, sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms, a subtlety that makes the silly, over-the-top coda especially disappointing.

Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking.
The entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood.
An affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary...
Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio, complete with receding hairline, weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice.

If director Michael Dowse only superficially understands his characters, he doesn't hold them in contempt.

The film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots, spy-on-the-run picture.
The animation is competent, and some of the gags are quite funny, but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive, morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment.

The gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of Chris Fuhrman's posthumously published cult novel.

Like all of Egoyan's work, Ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious.
An interesting story with a pertinent (cinematically unique) message, told fairly well and scored to perfection, I found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive ``missing thing.''
an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids, there's not enough intelligence, wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd.
How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing? In truth, it has all the heart of a porno flick (but none of the sheer lust).

You will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report.

Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan.
Less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling (though no less horrifying for it).
The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them, either.

The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of ``7th Heaven.''
If (Jaglom's) latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling, some of its repartee is still worth hearing.

A movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection.
if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage, then Esther's story is a compelling quest for truth.
The movie has a script (by Paul Pender) made of wood, and it's relentlessly folksy, a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions.
A weird, arresting little ride.
The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections.
I don't think this movie loves women at all.
Director Jay Russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning.
Apart from its own considerable achievement, Metropolis confirms Tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animÃ© tradition and its defining philosophical conscience.

The story feels more like a serious read, filled with heavy doses of always enticing Sayles dialogue.
The picture, scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination, is a monument to bad in all its florid variety.

Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself.

A somewhat crudely constructed but gripping, questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing, he becomes an enemy to his own race.
Several of Steven Soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist. Sadly, Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante.
Jaw-droppingly superficial, straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter's glory days on Three's Company.

A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan.
The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama: What would you have done to survive? The problem with the film is whether these ambitions, laudable in themselves, justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau.
Even during the climactic hourlong cricket match, boredom never takes hold.
Imagine (if possible) a Pasolini film without passion or politics, or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor, and you have some idea of the glum, numb experience of watching O Fantasma.

A film with a great premise but only a great premise.
Miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning, and his imagination so vivid, that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period, no timeout.
There are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected (and gentle) way.
A savage John Waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over.

Bartleby is a one-joke movie, and a bad joke at that.
All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto.

Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism.
(Schweiger is) talented and terribly charismatic, qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists.

Mr. Soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious.
It's more enjoyable than I expected, though, and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs. Cinematic pratfalls given a working over. The cast is spot on and the mood is laid back.

Wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror.
Anchored by Friel and Williams's exceptional performances, the film's power lies in its complexity. Nothing is black and white.

Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds.
Grant gets to display his cadness to perfection, but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte.
Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes: a setup, delivery and payoff. Stealing Harvard can't even do that much. Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth.
The IMAX screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation.
The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue, but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface.

The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well; a movie, like life, isn't much fun without the highs and lows.
I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness.

The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish.

...creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above...what could have been a melodramatic, Lifetime Channel-style anthology.
The very definition of what critics have come to term an ``ambitious failure.''
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.
It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while, but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
A film in a class with Spike Lee's masterful Do The Right Thing.
The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'Baran.'

Too often, the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance.

A confluence of kiddie entertainment, sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design.
A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard, particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers.

An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work, every bit as imperious as Katzenberg's The Prince of Egypt from 1998.
Bread, My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it. It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate. I admit it, I hate to like it.
The director knows how to apply textural gloss, but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom.
Ice Cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas, but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin.
A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect.
Bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
This version does justice both to Stevenson and to the sci-fi genre.
In gleefully, thumpingly hyperbolic terms, it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass, jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz.

If it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original, then SL2 does just that.

The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict, just like the movie does
The problem with this film is that it lacks focus. I sympathize with the plight of these families, but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand.

Cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio.
Fails to bring as much to the table.
A sweet, tender sermon about a 12-year-old Welsh boy more curious about God than girls, who learns that believing in something does matter.
Zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight.
The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts.

When your subject is illusion versus reality, shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real?

It made me feel unclean, and I'm the guy who liked There's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies. Oh, and Booty Call.

A dark, dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires.
More mature than Fatal Attraction, more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 Â½ Weeks, Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema.
Supposedly based upon real, or at least soberly reported incidents, the film ends with a large human tragedy. Alas, getting there is not even half the interest.
At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated (depending upon where you live), Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two.

The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated.
(Javier Bardem is) one of the few reasons to watch the film, which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama.
There's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie.

Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors...

A soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes...almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of B-movie imagination.

The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame.

This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of AmÃ©lie.

That Storytelling has value cannot be denied. Not even Solondz's thirst for controversy, sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it.

The ingenuity that Parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of Wilde himself.
May be far from the best of the series, but it's assured, wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation.

Works because we're never sure if Ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying, delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks.

The film reminds me of a vastly improved Germanic version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- with better characters, some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style. The difference is that I truly enjoyed most of Mostly Martha while I ne

It's a trifle of a movie, with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center.
Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to, but its energy can't compare to the wit, humor and snappy dialogue of the original. If I want music, I'll buy the soundtrack. If I want a real movie, I'll buy the Criterion DVD.
I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers.
The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life, but also acknowledging the places, and the people, from whence you came.

A well-executed spy-thriller.

It's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force.

The movie is as padded as Allen's jelly belly.
The film will appeal to Discovery Channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses.

A humorless journey into a philosophical void.

A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive.

Spectacularly beautiful, not to mention mysterious, sensual, emotionally intense, and replete with virtuoso throat-singing.
About Schmidt belongs to Nicholson. Gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances. As Schmidt, Nicholson walks with a slow, deliberate gait, chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance.

An inept, tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures, it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch, and no more.

The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots.

A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others.

...an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle.
If you're a Crocodile Hunter fan, you'll enjoy at least the ``real'' portions of the film. If you're looking for a story, don't bother.

Here, common sense flies out the window, along with the hail of bullets, none of which ever seem to hit Sascha.
The bottom line is the piece works brilliantly.
City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for. But how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery.
It's not only dull because we've seen (Eddie) Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death, but because the plot is equally hackneyed.

The inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise, but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line.

Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free.

One of the most plain, unimaginative romantic comedies I've ever seen.

It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, (yet) are worthwhile.

Nice piece of work.
Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary.

A movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events.
What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent.

A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance.
In the end, the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide.

Those who are only mildly curious, I fear, will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals.
Loud, silly, stupid and pointless.

Likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer.
Hugely accomplished slice of Hitchcockian suspense.

Something must have been lost in the translation.
Not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out, but it has clearly been made with affection and care.
A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film, but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time, and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun.
All very stylish and beautifully photographed, but far more trouble than it's worth, with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion.
It's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter, yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb.

Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description.

We've seen it all before in one form or another, but director Hoffman, with great help from Kevin Kline, makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher.
The delicious trimmings...arrive early and stay late, filling nearly every minute...with a lighthearted glow, some impudent snickers, and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two.
A lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable, but also unlistenable.

It's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground.
A thoughtful, moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty.

Because the genre is well established, what makes the movie fresh is smart writing, skewed characters, and the title performance by Kieran Culkin.
Bloody Sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame, making it one of the best war movies ever made. It's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough.
Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer, director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run, has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap.
...the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs.

Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick.

This movie is about lying, cheating, but loving the friends you betray.

The concept behind Kung Pow: Enter the Fist is hilarious. It's too bad nothing else is.
A special kind of movie, this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento...
Made me unintentionally famous -- as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby. But believe it or not, it's one of the most beautiful, evocative works I've seen.

...quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks.
What ensues are much blood-splattering, mass drug-induced bowel evacuations, and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits.

A deft, delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph.
Day is not a great Bond movie, but it is a good Bond movie, which still makes it much better than your typical Bond knock-offs.

The director, Mark Pellington, does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister, menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights, a rattling noise, and a bump on the head.
The production values are up there. The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick. The voices are fine as well. The problem, it is with most of these things, is the script.

A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen.
Low rent from frame one.
I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier, by Rohmer, for example.

Wang Xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men.

Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed.
Feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in Nine Queens.
While the glass slipper doesn't quite fit, Pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale.

Taken outside the context of the current political climate (see: terrorists are more evil than ever!), The Sum of All Fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller.

Bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing, if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste.

So brisk is Wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe.
Scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky.

A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns, expensive cars, lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing.

Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread.
The story, once it gets rolling, is nothing short of a great one.

Another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre.
The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times, give you a few laughs, and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks, even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end.
This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic.
The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than, say, ten... make that three minutes.
Human Resources was a good, straightforward tale, but Time Out is better. It's haunting. It's like a poem.
The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film.
From the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line, ``Besotted'' is misbegotten
Disjointed parody.
Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed, makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame.
Roman Coppola may never become the filmmaker his Dad was, but heck â few filmmakers will. But based on CQ, I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project.
Like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive, fitfully amusing, but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen.
While puerile men dominate the story, the women shine.
I highly recommend Irwin, but not in the way this film showcases him.
Bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake.
Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners, a fact which, as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs, seems inconceivable.
It's exactly the kind of movie Toback's detractors always accuse him of making.
The movie is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes.
It's a charming and often affecting journey.
If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star, wait until you've seen him eight stories tall.
Kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night Matthew was killed.
Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack.

While kids will probably eat the whole thing up, most adults will be way ahead of the plot.
Fans of Nijinsky will savor every minute of Cox's work.
It looks closely, insightfully at fragile, complex relationships.
To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow: Enter the Fist.
Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be.
A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room, complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms.
An awful snooze.
The doofus-on- the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky, after-hours loopiness to it. And as with most late-night bull sessions, eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is.
An intelligently made (and beautifully edited) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch.
The film is quiet, threatening and unforgettable.
The whole thing feels like a ruse, a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or, worse yet, nonexistent -- ideas.
The bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect, but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie.
By the time we learn that Andrew's Turnabout Is Fair Play is every bit as awful as Borchardt's Coven, we can enjoy it anyway.
It's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison.
This is a film well worth seeing, talking and singing heads and all.
fast, frantic and fun, but also soon forgotten
Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director, it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
The film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9/11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind.
Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation, which is way too stagy.
There are times when A Rumor of Angels plays like an extended episode of Touched by an Angel -- a little too much dancing, a few too many weeping scenes -- but I liked its heart and its spirit.
This charming but slight tale has warmth, wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed.
The film sometimes flags...but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk, amusing pace.
When it comes to entertainment, children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever.
Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film: a calm, self-assured portrait of small town regret, love, duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience.
The film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing, but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies.
The film offers an intriguing what-if premise.
The Pianist (is) a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we, today, can prevent its tragic waste of life. Here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life, his dignity and his music.
It's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman.
Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional.
...one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages...
Puportedly ``Based on True Events,'' a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is ``Based on a True Story'' with a straight face.
With each of her three protagonists, Miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life, out of a deep-seated, emotional need, is about to turn onto a different path.
The Son Of The Bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline, which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues. This movie is to be cherished.
By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it, and, of course, feeling guilty for it.... Then, miracle of miracles, the movie does a flip-flop.
If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum, her tough, funny, rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time.
It's just a little too self-satisfied.
Late Marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet.
No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story.
Nothing more than a mediocre trifle.
It's refreshing to see a romance this smart.
When your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon at their raunchy best, even hokum goes down easily.
...one of the more influential works of the 'Korean New Wave'.
If you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies, what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever.
A graceless, witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller.
Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens, obsessive relationships, and rampant adultery so dull.
A stirring, funny and finally transporting re-imagining of Beauty and the Beast and 1930s horror films
What we have here isn't a disaster, exactly, but a very handsomely produced let-down.
Sandra Bullock's best dramatic performance to date (is) almost enough to lift (this) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser...above its paint-by-numbers plot.
Jolting into Charleston rhythms, the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent (accurate? Who cares?).
Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama.
Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence, composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor, or an absurdist workplace sitcom.
Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1.8 million charmer, which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart.
Witless and utterly pointless.
Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood's Dirty Harry period.
It's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances, from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke.
It's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller.

Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good, it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing.
At a brief 42 minutes, we need more X and less blab.
An invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to Massoud, whose charm, cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent.
4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos, but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly.
The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold.
Although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play, the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs.

Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped, they prove more distressing than suspenseful.
Despite its title, Punch-Drunk Love is never heavy-handed. The jabs it employs are short, carefully placed and dead-center.
It strikes hardest... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain. Fifty years after the fact, the world's political situation seems little different, and (director Phillip) Noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill.
While not all that bad of a movie, it's nowhere near as good as the original.
Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-Semitism ever seen on screen.
Worthy of the gong.
(T)here's only so much anyone can do with a florid, overplotted, Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them.
True to its title, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at.
A sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away.
If it's another regurgitated action movie you're after, there's no better film than Half Past Dead.

Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination.
Though only 60 minutes long, the film is packed with information and impressions.
Flawed, but worth seeing for Ambrose's performance.
A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast, but never quite gets off the ground.
I admired this work a lot.
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
Yes, Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination, but it's also a failure of storytelling.
By the time the surprise ending is revealed, interest cannot be revived.
Davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces.
Crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy, existential exploration of why men leave their families.
It has the right approach and the right opening premise, but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material.
Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White's dry wit to a new age.
(T)he ideas of Revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
There's nothing remotely topical or sexy here.
One of the year's best films, featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore.
This movie ... doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is.
Neither the funniest film that Eddie Murphy nor Robert De Niro has ever made, Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while. Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon, anyway.
It's a fine, focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism.
A fast, funny, highly enjoyable movie.
Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichÃ©s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block.
(A) superbly controlled, passionate adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 novel.
A muckraking job, the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment, and a fairly effective one at that.
With youthful high spirits, Tautou remains captivating throughout Michele's religious and romantic quests, and she is backed by a likable cast.
It's just not very smart.
Perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing,' but it is. 'Drumline' shows a level of young, Black manhood that is funny, touching, smart and complicated.
``Red Dragon'' is entertaining. An obvious copy of one of the best films ever made, how could it not be? But it is entertaining on an inferior level. It is a popcorn film, not a must-own, or even a must-see.
I'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled, but, for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway, The Hours represents two of those well spent.
It's the type of stunt the Academy loves: a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film.
Ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier.
A full world has been presented onscreen, not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution.
If you're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri, you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake. Personally, I'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet.
Blessed with two fine, nuanced lead performances.
Don't waste your money.
A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401(k) statement.
This is a movie full of grace and, ultimately, hope.
An enthralling, entertaining feature.
A chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president, but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten, cynical journalists into what was essentially, by campaign's end, an extended publicity department.
Although no pastry is violated, this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts, boobs, unmentionables -- without much success.
Will undoubtedly play well in European markets, where Mr. Besson is a brand name, and in Asia, where Ms. Shu is an institution, but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic.
Ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent Chinese immigrant's experiences in New York City.
Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths. Marisa Tomei is good, but Just A Kiss is just a mess.
Suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers.
A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise.
``Me Without You'' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades.
Parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
The cast is phenomenal, especially the women.
Half Submarine flick, Half Ghost Story, All in one criminally neglected film
Notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour, I'm going to recommend SECRETARY, based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal, and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
The film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity.
Extreme Oops - oops, ops, no matter how you spell it, it's still a mistake to go see it.
A portrait of an artist.
If The Man from Elysian Fields is doomed by its smallness, it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out.
Although very much like the first movie based on J.K. Rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers, this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing, headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude.
The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America.
An honest, sensitive story from a Vietnamese point of view.
Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings.
The entire movie is in need of a scented bath.
Several uninteresting, unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in ``Unfaithful.'' Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me.
Touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes, not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants.
Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically, and borrows heavily from Lynch, Jeunet, and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own.
It's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie, trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness.
A depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description ``unelected'' have suspected all along: George W. Bush is an incurious, uncharismatic, overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide.
(It's) a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest.
The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing.
Beautifully crafted and brutally honest, Promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the Middle East struggle and into the humanity of its people.
A twisty, moody slice of Southern Gothic...
Watching these two actors play against each other so intensely, but with restraint, is a treat.
Despite the film's shortcomings, the stories are quietly moving.
Andy Garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and Mick Jagger gives his best movie performance since, well, Performance.
The sort of picture in which, whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do, they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset.
If you like blood, guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though... you will likely enjoy this monster.
Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing, teeth-gnashing actorliness.
The actors are appealing, but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental.
Assured, glossy and shot through with brittle desperation.
Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together.
Falls neatly into the category of Good Stupid Fun.
An encouraging effort from McCrudden
an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
The movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture, and comes across as darkly funny, energetic, and surprisingly gentle.
Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them, Tarantula and other low- budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s, the movie is a silly (but not sophomoric) romp through horror and hellish conditions.
This is mild-mannered, been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant, the outrageous.
At times THE GUYS taps into some powerful emotions, but this kind of material is more effective on stage. It's not a motion picture; it's an utterly static picture.
The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure, and you find yourself rooting for Gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her.
A playful Iranian parable about openness, particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences.
Jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs, ideally capturing the opera's drama and lyricism.
It's a frightful vanity film that, no doubt, pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni.
It appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making.
If the movie were all comedy, it might work better. But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects, but not a willingness.
It just goes to show, an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller.
(Davis) has a bright, chipper style that keeps things moving, while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race.
A puzzle whose pieces do not fit. Some are fascinating and others are not, and in the end, it is almost a good movie.
By the end of the movie, you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular.
Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in.
Ramsay and Morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling.
It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun.
Nothing happens, and it happens to flat characters.
Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing.
Although Huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it, The Piano Teacher is anything but fun.
Without Shakespeare's eloquent language, the update is dreary and sluggish.
It's made with deftly unsettling genre flair.
Subversive, meditative, clinical and poetic, The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius.
Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within.
The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield.
The second chapter of the Harry Potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year.
Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness.
I'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept, but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clichÃ©.
Dawdles and drags when it should pop; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding.
You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack, or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production.
(A) Hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning...(but) Lohman's moist, deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer...
This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People.
If S&M seems like a strange route to true love, maybe it is, but it's to this film's (and its makers') credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves.
Brave and sweetly rendered love story.
National Lampoon's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
An estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote (and cannier doppelganger) to Diesel's XXX flex-a-thon.
More dutiful than enchanting...terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat.
Your taste for Jonah - A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit.
Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene: neither as funny nor as clever, though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes.
The charms of willful eccentricity, at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay, are beginning to wear a bit thin.
This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected. In fact, it's quite fun in places.
While the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times, it's awfully entertaining to watch.
Instead of making his own style, director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources â good sources, bad mixture
Very stupid and annoying.

The tale of Tok (Andy Lau), a sleek sociopath on the trail of O (Takashi Sorimachi), the most legendary of Asian hitmen, is too scattershot to take hold.
It's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice.
Henry Bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers, but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
Home Alone goes Hollywood, a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do. Besides, real movie producers aren't this nice.
The movie's eventual success should be credited to Dennis Quaid, in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
Too damn weird to pass up, and for the blacklight crowd, way cheaper (and better) than Pink Floyd tickets.
Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning.
At every opportunity to do something clever, the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
a huge disappointment coming, as it does, from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary. But here's the real damn: It isn't funny, either.
The film is all a little Lit Crit 101, but it's extremely well played and often very funny.
A gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices.
The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.
A dull, simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs, death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets.
Long before it's over, you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser.
Miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise, expertly plucking tension from quiet.
The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest, but its just not a thrilling movie.

Reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking.
The more you think about the movie, the more you will probably like it.

Narc may not get an 'A' for originality, but it wears its B-movie heritage like a badge of honor.
Corny, schmaltzy and predictable, but still manages to be kind of heartwarming, nonetheless. It's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain. At all.
The Pianist is the film Roman Polanski may have been born to make.
A sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy, while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that, while past, really isn't.
The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is.
I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson.
Like Shrek, Spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children, because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world.
Murderous Maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth.
Insanely hilarious! I haven't laughed that hard in years!
It is a film that will have people walking out halfway through, will encourage others to stand up and applaud, and will, undoubtedly, leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come.
Forget the misleading title, what's with the unexplained baboon cameo?
Discursive but oddly riveting documentary.
One of the most highly-praised disappointments I've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time.
Tells (the story) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of (being) in a shrugging mood.
With generic sets and B-grade special effects, Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as TV's defunct Cleopatra 2525.
Schrader examines Crane's decline with unblinking candor.
Sometimes charming, sometimes infuriating, this Argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors.
A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality.
Though it draws several decent laughs, it's low-cal Woody at best.
Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters, but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers.
The central story lacks punch.
A soul-stirring documentary about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds.
Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor, and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do.
Arty gay film.
A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of.
(A) crushing disappointment.
The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive, yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive, lovely place where we suspend our disbelief.
Why come up with something even quasi-original, when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson, Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED?
A smart, sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy.

The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments.
Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them.
The movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances.
Far more enjoyable than its predecessor.
Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can, but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting.
The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison.
After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly, sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be, you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be.
Some Body will take you places you haven't been, and also places you have.
It's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue, only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary, pasty lumpen.
As literary desecrations go, this makes for perfectly acceptable, occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment. You'll forget about it by Monday, though, and if they're old enough to have developed some taste, so will your kids.

Halloween: Resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema, but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been.

Assayas' ambitious, sometimes beautiful adaptation of Jacques Chardonne's novel.

The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes (of which they'll get plenty) fills me with revulsion.

Should have been someone else-
... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun.
Mostly works because of the universal themes, earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh.

Lazy, miserable and smug. This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.
Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances.

Light, silly, photographed with colour and depth, and rather a good time.
A movie with a real anarchic flair.

A true pleasure.

Would Benigni's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster?

On top of a foundering performance, (Madonna's) denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag.

Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects, implausibility, and sags in pace, it rises in its courageousness, and comedic employment.

It has a caffeinated, sloppy brilliance, sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care, but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame.

One of the greatest films I've ever seen.

Some episodes work, some don't.
An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic.

Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick, and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all.

A dark, quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation.
Solid, lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts.

Too much power, not enough puff.

Beautifully produced.

It is nature against progress. In Fessenden's horror trilogy, this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale.
Witless, pointless, tasteless and idiotic.
Some of the computer animation is handsome, and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale, but overall the film never rises above mediocrity.
Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced, false and fabricated.

Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out, cannot overcome blah characters.
This is mostly well-constructed fluff, which is all it seems intended to be.
It won't harm anyone, but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it. After all, it'll probably be in video stores by Christmas, and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies.

The structure is simple, but in its own way, Rabbit-Proof Fence is a quest story as grand as The Lord of the Rings.
This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers. For the rest of us, sitting through Dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment.
It's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss. Rather, pity anyone who sees this mishmash.

A heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic, the work of a genuine and singular artist.
Narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films. It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special.

Yes, one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong, determined monarch, but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature.

It's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion.
The ending is a cop-out. What happens to John Q? I don't have an I Am Sam clue.

The smash 'em-up, crash 'em-up, shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense.
Be patient with the lovely Hush! and your reward will be a thoughtful, emotional movie experience.

For a film that celebrates radical, nonconformist values, What to Do in Case of Fire? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional, reserved kind of filmmaking.

Narratively, Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess.

The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy, something from a Halloween that died.

It's the kind of under-inspired, overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name.
In an effort, I suspect, not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted, it offends by just being wishy-washy.

Once the downward spiral comes to pass, Auto Focus bears out as your typical junkie opera...

MacDowell ... gives give a solid, anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done.

Attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage.
The movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast.
Strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing.
Exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven... (the film) addresses in a fascinating, intelligent manner the intermingling of race, politics and local commerce.
A 'Girls Gone Wild' video for the boho art-house crowd, The Burning Sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that.
What makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people, in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship, bring to their music.

The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie.
Poignant and funny.

It's still a comic book, but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul.
Welles groupie/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it, but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst.
Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary.
A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue, heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment, and an overly-familiar set of plot devices.
Fun and nimble.

When it really counts ... Bloody Sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language.
Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances.

Like being trapped inside a huge video game, where exciting, inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again.

With Dirty Deeds, David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen.

Just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole.
Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western, it's an unpretentious, sociologically pointed slice of life.

A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship.
You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go, but it never quite gets there.
A work of astonishing delicacy and force.

The only thing worse than your substandard, run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound.
This is one of Polanski's best films.
As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso, Sia lacks visual flair. But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast, and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie, no matter who runs them.
The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish.
The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine.' But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless.
While Broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture, it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system.

The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about.
The leads are so unmemorable, despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes, that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material.
The charm of the first movie is still there, and the story feels like the logical, unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids.
It's too long, too repetitive, and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner.
An unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story.
Instead of using George and Lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks, Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere, seizing on George's haplessness and Lucy's personality tics.

Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name.
A thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale, standard, connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world.
A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy French grandfather.

like a poor man's You Can Count On Me

Feels untidily honest.
Even in the summertime, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities.
Invincible is a wonderful movie.
Will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them.
Brainy, artistic and muted, almost to the point of suffocation.

An ambitious and moving but bleak film.

The documentary does little, apart from raising the topic, to further stoke the conversation.
Thanks to Haynes' absolute control of the film's mood, and buoyed by three terrific performances, Far From Heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act.
Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes, and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame, it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities.
It's immensely ambitious, different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do.
The story has little wit and no surprises.
Dazzling and sugar-sweet, a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex, scandal, and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver.

As a film director, LaBute continues to improve.
The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it.

It's obvious (Je-Gyu is) trying for poetry; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom.

Certainly the performances are worthwhile.

more precious than perspicacious

Just dreadful. I don't blame Eddie Murphy but shouldn't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script?
Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies, and he gives none to the audience.
A plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists.
Obviously, a lot of people wasted a lot of their time (including mine) on something very inconsequential.
If the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying, its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start.
Two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama.
It's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness, and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing.
It doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.
While there's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying 'Get in the car, bitch,' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer

The filmmakers know how to please the eye, but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story.
Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers.

It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears, to be a girl in a world of boys, to be a boy truly in love with a girl, and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you.
There's something auspicious, and daring, too, about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A.I. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority.
A fascinating, bombshell documentary that should shame Americans, regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with Kissinger. Should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike.

What a dumb, fun, curiously adolescent movie this is.

It's not without its pleasures, but I'll stick with The Tune.
The plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story. But while the highly predictable narrative falls short, Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold.
A half-assed film.
You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions.
``Bad'' is the operative word for ``Bad Company,'' and I don't mean that in a good way.
Like a grinning Jack O' Lantern, its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy, having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded.

``...something appears to have been lost in the translation this time. The Importance of Being Earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play.''
Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists, who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic.
Sad nonsense, this. But not without cheesy fun factor.
Who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this, the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy, directed by Godfrey Reggio, with music by Philip Glass?
'Possession,' based on the book by A.S. Byatt, demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit

What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian.
Cuaron repeatedly, perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it, giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective.

All in all, Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence.
Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin, inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder.

It doesn't quite work, but there's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos' next offering.
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth, Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material.
The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances, but the result is disappointing.

The word that comes to mind, while watching Eric Rohmer's tribute to a courageous Scottish lady, is painterly.

A pretty funny movie, with most of the humor coming, as before, from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro.

The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel.

In the end, Ted Bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac; there's no larger point, and little social context.

The script isn't very good; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman (the actor) can make it work.

Performances all around are tops, with the two leads delivering Oscar-caliber performances.

Both awful and appealing.
A solid examination of the male midlife crisis.
Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses, but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length.

The result is an 'action film' mired in stasis.

In other words, it's just another sports drama/character study. Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness. Plus, like I already mentioned...it's Robert Duvall! C'mon!
Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures? Wouldn't one about their famous dad, author of Death in Venice, etc., be more valuable?

The Mothman Prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey.
Strip it of all its excess debris, and you'd have a 90-minute, four-star movie. As it is, it's too long and unfocused.

A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception, which, while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces, is still very much worth seeing.
Halfway through the movie, the humor dwindles. It's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have (and probably should have) been a lighthearted comedy.
Intriguing and downright intoxicating.
If you liked the 1982 film then, you'll still like it now.

The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines.
Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors, sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent.
This is a stunning film, a one-of-a-kind tour de force.
Many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside, and I don't think that A.C. will help this movie one bit.

We are left with a superficial snapshot that, however engaging, is insufficiently enlightening and inviting.

This is cruel, misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy.
Becomes a bit of a mishmash: a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't.

Involving at times, but lapses quite casually into the absurd.
A fairly enjoyable mixture of Longest Yard ... and the 1999 Guy Ritchie caper Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike, Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire.
Fantastic!
Morton uses her face and her body language to bring us Morvern's soul, even though the character is almost completely deadpan.

A witty, trenchant, wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking.
Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks, but not anyone else.
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid...a curiously constricted epic.
Falls short in explaining the music and its roots.
This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention, than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment.
It's a hellish, numbing experience to watch, and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already, back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s.
The film might have been more satisfying if it had, in fact, been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles.

I'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence: This erotic cannibal movie is boring.

Some movies blend together as they become distant memories. Mention ``Solaris'' five years from now and I'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share.

A timely look back at civil disobedience, anti-war movements and the power of strong voices.
A sensitive, moving, brilliantly constructed work.

With a confrontational stance, Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families.

A surprisingly funny movie.

Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy, and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation.

An absorbing, slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true.
For all its violence, the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression.
The punch lines that miss, unfortunately, outnumber the hits by three-to-one. But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end.

Exhilarating but blatantly biased.
``Brown Sugar'' admirably aspires to be more than another ``Best Man'' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film.
Frida isn't that much different from many a Hollywood romance. What sets it apart is the vision that Taymor, the avant garde director of Broadway's The Lion King and the film Titus, brings.

A technically well-made suspenser...but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide.
Everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting.

Bland but harmless.
A breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom, while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters.
There's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes.

The Master Of Disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy.
Wilco fans will have a great time, and the movie should win the band a few new converts, too.

Cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most.
... a joke at once flaky and resonant, lightweight and bizarrely original.
The furious coherence that (DeNiro) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself, which feels, as it plods toward the end, less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing.
Like most sequels, it takes what worked last time, repeats it and adds more characters, more stunts, more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness.
Madonna has made herself over so often now, there's apparently nothing left to work with, sort of like Michael Jackson's nose.

Its premise is smart, but the execution is pretty weary.
'Butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth, who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach.
A classy, sprightly spin on film.
Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas.

The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers, but if you go in knowing that, you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox.
Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, Tom Clancy's intrepid hero? Ridiculous. What's next? D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones? Or Tom Green as Han Solo?
Perhaps the best sports movie I've ever seen.
A bizarre piece of work, with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy, rape and suspected murder

Working from Elliott's memoir, Rohmer fashions the sort of delicate, articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades.
A must see for all sides of the political spectrum

The wonder of Mostly Martha is the performance of Gedeck, who makes Martha enormously endearing.
Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd.
A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise.
Plays like one long, meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz, rather than a fully developed story.
Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002.
Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances, but they're often undone by Howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject.
A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit.
Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits.
Gets the look and the period trappings right, but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichÃ©s.
just not campy enough
This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time.
An Asian neo-realist treasure.
How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us.

The only thing ``swept away'' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time.
It is bad, but certainly not without merit as entertainment.

All ends well, sort of, but the frenzied comic moments never click.
It might not be 1970s animation, but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons â a retread story, bad writing, and the same old silliness.
Blisteringly rude, scarily funny, sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys, the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden.
The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show: hastily written, underrehearsed, arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo.
The real triumphs in Igby come from Philippe, who makes Oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest, and Sarandon, who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable WASP matron.
True to its animatronic roots:...as stiff, ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus...'The Country Bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation.
Brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness.

Has its moments, but it's pretty far from a treasure.
...a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking.
A simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them.
The results, if not memorable, are at least interesting.

Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451.

Despite an overwrought ending, the film works as well as it does because of the performances.
The whole mildly pleasant outing -- the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air, but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen.
(Siegel) and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie.

The Mothman Prophecies, which is mostly a bore, seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece.
Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian's inane ramblings, Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore.
You have to pay attention to follow all the stories, but they're each interesting. The movie is well shot and very tragic, and one to ponder after the credits roll.
On a cutting room floor somewhere lies...footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant, ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire.
Handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy.

``its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right.''
Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot, expertly cast, paced with crisp professionalism... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report.
Who is the audience for Cletis Tout? Anybody who enjoys quirky, fun, popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed.

There was time on that second round to see the subtleties of Ramsay's portrait of grief.
Cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are, with the drumming routines, among the film's saving graces.

The production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable.
Dragonfly has no atmosphere, no tension -- nothing but Costner, flailing away. It's a buggy drag.

The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun.
Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs.
Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year.
Unlike most teen flicks, Swimming takes its time to tell its story, casts mostly little-known performers in key roles, and introduces some intriguing ambiguity.
Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug, but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be.
When one hears Harry Shearer is going to make his debut as a film director, one would hope for the best

One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters.
Many insightful moments.
Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible.
Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand.

The film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence.
By no means a great movie, but it is a refreshingly forthright one.
Those of you who don't believe in Santa Claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original. Well, this movie proves you wrong on both counts.
Jackie Chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing.

Pretension, in its own way, is a form of bravery. For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast, hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal.
The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original, while the Oscar-winning sound and James Horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system.
It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias, especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise.
This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento (a producer here), but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic.

Bluto Blutarsky, we miss you.
It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up.

While there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp, the production works more often than it doesn't.
Directing with a sure and measured hand, (Haneke) steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology.
It's provocative stuff, but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that Hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances.
A movie just for Friday fans, critics be damned. If you already like this sort of thing, this is that sort of thing all over again.
The movie tries to be ethereal, but ends up seeming goofy.

This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece, in treading the line between sappy and sanguine, winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand.

Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago.
As if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges, Kathryn Bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness. Her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant.

Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would.

Whether Kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question, but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion.
Oscar Wilde's masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, may be the best play of the 19th century. It's so good that its relentless, polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions, but even Oliver Parker's movie adaptation.
Freundlich's made (Crudup) a suburban architect, and a cipher.
Ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted, from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke.

An incendiary, deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar (and peculiarly venomous) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy

Wanker Goths are on the loose! Run for your lives!

Formuliac, but fun.

Depending upon your reaction to this movie, you may never again be able to look at a red felt Sharpie pen without disgust, a thrill, or the giggles.

The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming, but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes

To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree.

A solid, spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket.
The movie is a trove of delights.

Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness, although, it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious.

A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial.

A riveting documentary.
Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs, its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before.

If there's no art here, it's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days.
It's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious.

Jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama.
If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride, don't settle for this Imposter.

A journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling, but which Hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking.
Before long, the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon.

The acting in Pauline And Paulette is good all round, but what really sets the film apart is Debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons.

A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative, of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking.
It's a smartly directed, grown-up film of ideas.

The Scorpion King is more fun than Conan the Barbarian.
A heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts.
A low-budget affair, Tadpole was shot on digital video, and the images often look smeary and blurry, to the point of distraction. Then again, in a better movie, you might not have noticed.

You'll get the enjoyable basic minimum. But not a whit more.

The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true. This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of.

The spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist.
A pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings, the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable.

Rarely do films come along that are as intelligent, exuberant, and moving as Monsoon Wedding.

Gondry's direction is adequate ... but what gives Human Nature its unique feel is Kaufman's script.

In XXX, Diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners, and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep.

Where the film falters is in its tone.

Whether you like rap music or loathe it, you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie.

A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot.

Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart, Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain.
The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher.

It's a tour de force, written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear.

Absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way.
Haneke's script (from Elfriede Jelinek's novel) is contrived, unmotivated, and psychologically unpersuasive, with an inconclusive ending.
Each scene wreaks of routine; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense.
A French film with a more down-home flavor.
A dull, inconsistent, dishonest female bonding picture.
(Allen) manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise.

A moving essay about the specter of death, especially suicide.
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks.
I'm just too bored to care.
The simplicity of The Way Home has few equals this side of Aesop
Too ordinary to restore (Harmon) to prominence, despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors, and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience.

This u-boat doesn't have a captain.
Though writer/director Bart Freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship, it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup's anchoring performance.
Seems like someone going through the motions.
It's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants, pull an arrow out of his back, and leap unscathed through raging fire!
The great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses â and ours â and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash, and send it to its proper home.
Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls, stubbly chins, liver spots, red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere.
A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work.
What it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and B-grade stylishness.
By the time it ends in a rush of sequins, flashbulbs, blaring brass and back-stabbing babes, it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better.
You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time.
Tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm, but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality.
Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often.
If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.

A woefully dull, redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation, despite Iwai's vaunted empathy.
Bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show, and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch Some Body first.
This is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters, and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives.
A loving little film of considerable appeal.
A quietly reflective and melancholy New Zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life.
Although I didn't hate this one, it's not very good either. It can be safely recommended as a video/DVD babysitter.
It desperately wants to be a wacky, screwball comedy, but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time.

A big fat pain.
Return to Never Land may be another shameless attempt by Disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families, but it's not half-bad.
Ratliff's two previous titles, Plutonium Circus and Purgatory County show his penchant for wry, contentious configurations, and this film is part of that delicate canon.
Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense, and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly.
The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired.

A tired, unnecessary retread...a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with.

The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema, only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage.

No one can doubt the filmmakers' motives, but The Guys still feels counterproductive.
I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done.

Oh come on. Like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away.
An intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time.
A delightful stimulus for the optic nerves, so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow.
An interesting look behind the scenes of Chicago-based rock group Wilco...
There are so few films about the plight of American Indians in modern America that Skins comes as a welcome, if downbeat, missive from a forgotten front.
The movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster.

It's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak. But what spectacular sizzle it is!...In this incarnation its fizz is infectious.
Girls gone wild and gone civil again
Greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past, and he is matched by Schweig, who carries the film on his broad, handsome shoulders.

This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar.
(Shyamalan) turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit, purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count.

To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
An idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone.
The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year, noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take.

The entire movie has a truncated feeling, but what's available is lovely and lovable.
The film can depress you about life itself.
Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing, Who Is Cletis Tout? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche.
Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene, 'Swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling.

What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona, here a more annoying, though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild, undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip.
One of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since The Evil Dead.
Generic thriller junk. Teens only.
Knows how to make our imagination wonder.
Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here.

Just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over.
A must for fans of British cinema, if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride.
When it's all wet, Blue Crush is highly enjoyable. When it's on dry land, though, this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper.
This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... But it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie.
A mild, reluctant, thumbs down.
What's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an Ikea world.
As a first-time director, Paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides Frailty with its dark soul.
It's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and, not far down the line, to find a place among the studio's animated classics.
Nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you. He makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty.
Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment.
There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility, not an event that is believable, not a confrontation that is not staged, not a moment that is not false.
It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental, and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients.

Though Lan Yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency, the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude.
It's definitely a step in the right direction.
Generally, Clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler, while happily killing 94 minutes.
It uses an old-time formula, it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big, dumb, happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
The bland outweighs the nifty, and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is.
this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers, it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered.
Unlike most anime, whose most ardent fans outside Japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes, Metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile.
This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer.
It's a treat watching Shaw, a British stage icon, melting under the heat of Phocion's attentions.
With Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, however, Robert Rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking.
Doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago.
Morton deserves an Oscar nomination.
The movie feels like it's going to be great, and it carries on feeling that way for a long time, but takeoff just never happens.

The modern remake of Dumas's story is long on narrative and (too) short on action.
Get out your pooper-scoopers.

A dreary movie.
Pacino is the best he's been in years and Keener is marvelous.

Horrible.

Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core.
The so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing (featuring the voices of Glenn Close, Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer) brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks.
The kind of primal storytelling that George Lucas can only dream of.
Whether you're moved and love it, or bored or frustrated by the film, you'll still feel something.
No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population.
The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground, perhaps too much, but ties things together, neatly, by the end.

Death to Smoochy is often very funny, but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito's misanthropic vision.
In a movie full of surprises, the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy, both gentle and biting.
A shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait, shot in artful, watery tones of blue, green and brown.

To my taste, the film's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation.
Though excessively tiresome, The Uncertainty Principle, as verbally pretentious as the title may be, has its handful of redeeming features, as long as you discount its ability to bore.

Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life, but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director, Tony R. Abrams, in their feature debut.

A gripping drama.

Like its title character, Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating.
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue

A compelling film.

If you're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog.

Ice Cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance...

The drama discloses almost nothing.

A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot.
An absorbing and unsettling psychological drama.
The Ya-Ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better. Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be Ya-Ya.
This is a picture that Maik, the firebrand turned savvy ad man, would be envious of: it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool.
Invigorating, surreal, and resonant with a rainbow of emotion.
The performances are amiable and committed, and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye.

The concert footage is stirring, the recording sessions are intriguing, and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers.
Norton holds the film together.
A perfectly respectable, perfectly inoffensive, easily forgettable film.

This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash.
Two hours of junk.

Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance.

Writer-director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured.
...a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job...

Another trumpet blast that there may be a New Mexican Cinema a-bornin'.
Rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword, Jiang Wen's Devils on the Doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut.
Nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion, rather than the overuse of special effects.
It all unfolds predictably, and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time, providing no real sense of suspense.

Featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.
No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas.

likeable thanks to its cast, its cuisine and its quirky tunes.
Don't let your festive spirit go this far.

The picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed.
Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up: everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter.
It is depressing, ruthlessly pained and depraved, the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound.
The touch is generally light enough and the performances, for the most part, credible.

A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others, thanks to the actors, that are quite touching.

A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas.
A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary.

One of those rare, exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight, as you mull over its every nuance in your mind.

Made me feel uneasy, even queasy, because (Solondz's) cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt.

As expected, Sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever, though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances.
The Sweetest Thing, a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies, may be a mess in a lot of ways. But it does have one saving grace. A lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view.

There's too much falseness to the second half, and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull, ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging.
It is a kickass, dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some. I haven't seen one in so long, no wonder I didn't recognize it at first.

A lot smarter than your average Bond.

Meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil.
Hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a Japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation.

Refreshing.
Highly irritating at first, Mr. Koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results.

The script kicks in, and Mr. Hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow.
It's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction.
The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context, which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots (or cinema seats).

... has virtually no script at all ...
Uneven but a lot of fun.

Against all odds in heaven and hell, it creeped me out just fine.
A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle.
Possession is in the end an honorable, interesting failure. It falls far short of poetry, but it's not bad prose.

A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either.
A movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be.
Cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche.

Impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately lacking in substance, not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act.
Light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection. Which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors.
There's little to recommend Snow Dogs, unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity.
Bursting through the constraints of its source, this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen.
The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama, but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul's perspective.
By the end, you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake Petrovich (that would be Reno) gets his comeuppance. Just bring on the Battle Bots, please!

The kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you.

A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the New Age.
There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances, but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy.
A quiet, disquieting triumph.

A weird and wonderful comedy.
There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew.
The inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth.
The Ring is worth a look, if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment.
Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone.
